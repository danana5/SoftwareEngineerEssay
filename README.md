# Ben Goodger - The Creator of Enemies
Ben Goodger was born in London England but grew up in New Zealand. His contribution to the world of Computer Science is Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. Which as you can imagine are quite the same yet so different. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are two of the most popular and widely browsers in the world. I found Ben very interesting for the fact that he was a founding member on both of these very common applications.

### Early Career
Ben started his career as a software engineer by studying Computer Systems Engineering at The University of Auckland in which he graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in 2002. Prior to his graduation Goodger worked as an intern for Netscape Communications Corporation. He started as an intern in the Navigator group who were the owner of Mozilla user interface module in 2000-2001.

Netscape Navigator was the original browser of the Netscape line. It was the flagship project from Netscape. In the 1990â€™s it was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share.

At Netscape he implemented several components of the Netscape 6/Mozilla interface including refinements to the general look and feel. He also worked to improve the performance of the application and functionality. It was at Netscape where Goodger honed in his skills in web development and design. 
Towards the end of his time at Netscape circa 2003, Goodger was focused on research and development of client software for social asset sharing and management.
